# First_Year_Second_Sem_Project_Image_Steganography_C

This is the project our team did in second semester in C++. This is the final source code . This project is called "Image Steganography". This only works for 24-bit bmp images.

# How-To-Run

You can find .exe file inside bin\Debug with some of sample images in same directory.
Run the .exe file. Other information are within the program.

# Source-Code

Our Source Code is there, but it's messy as heck. Just try to figure out what it does based on identifiers name, and some comments. I'll comment it sometimes later.
